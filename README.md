# Call-Centre-Query-Analysis-Report
I developed this Power BI dashboard to analyze key performance metrics for a call center. The goal was to provide insights into agent efficiency and customer satisfaction, enabling better decision-making for improved operations.
<br>
<br>
Key Metrics:
<br>
Sum of Customer Satisfaction Ratings: This metric shows the total satisfaction ratings given by customers to individual agents.
<br>
Average Call Ratings: I calculated the average rating for all calls handled by agents to gauge overall performance.
<br>
Calls Answered by Agents: This tracks the total number of calls answered by each agent, helping to monitor workload distribution.
<br>
Average Speed of Answer (ASA): This metric represents the average time agents take to answer customer calls, measured in seconds, to assess responsiveness.
<br>
Count of Time to Answer: I included this to show the total number of instances related to the time it took agents to answer calls.
<br>
Count of Calls per Agent: This displays the number of calls managed by each agent, providing insights into individual productivity.
<br>
Average Speed of Answer (in Seconds): This specific metric highlights the speed at which agents answer calls, helping to evaluate time efficiency.
<br>
<br>
Visualizations:
<br>
I used various graphs and charts to visualize these metrics, making it easier to:
<br>
<br>
Compare agent performance.
<br>
Track trends in customer satisfaction.
<br>
Identify patterns in response time and efficiency.
<br>
<br>
This project allowed me to showcase my Power BI skills in data visualization and analysis while providing actionable insights to enhance call center operations and improve customer service.
